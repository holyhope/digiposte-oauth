# Digiposte oauth

This go package aims to provide oauth2 endpoint for digiposte.fr.
digiposte.fr is a french service provided by La Poste (the french post office) to store and share documents.
It is similar to Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.

Officially, digiposte.fr does not provide any oauth2 endpoint.
This package is a workaround to connect to digiposte.fr using oauth2.
